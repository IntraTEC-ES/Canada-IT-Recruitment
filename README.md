Technical Recruiter

My strongest accomplishments are in Networking, High End Technical Recruitment, Policy Creation, Change Management and Employee Relations. I am a seasoned Entrepreneurial Recruiter, Leader, Mentor, HR Generalist, Corporate Recruiter and Trainer. I strive to ensure superior customer service. I drive success through traditional and creative strategies, and I hold the values of integrity, partnership and innovation as cornerstones of my success. The selection process is not only about sourcing and staffing the right new hire, it is also about ensuring all candidates exit the process speaking positively about their experience and the company. My philosophy is: "If you do today what you have done yesterday you can expect the same results today as you had yesterday. If those results are acceptable, continue, if not, seek change."  I understand that leadership and vision moves a product or service to market, but it is the skill and knowledge - people - that provide the expertise for success - the qualities of technical and corporate fit. I align leadership, vision, skill, knowledge and fit on behalf of my internal and external clients.
